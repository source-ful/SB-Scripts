"""

This script functions as a precursour for the farming.py script, due to my lack of knowledge of the libraries used.
As a result, this simple script will function to teach my the libraries aswell as principles of automation.

This script will not be used in the final product, but will be used to teach me the libraries and principles of automation.
Note: While this script will not be used in the final product, it will be included in the repository for reference & documentation.
